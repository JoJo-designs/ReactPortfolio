This is my personal react portfolio. I based it off my current portfolio designs and I really like how it turned out. I made the portfolio as visually appealing as possible to show off my ability to design and build projects. The UI is clean and I think it shows off my unique set of skills very well. It is also responsive and will allow visiter it interact with it.

People can look at my projects and download a PDf of my most recent resumé. I also added links to my linkedin, github and youtube.
